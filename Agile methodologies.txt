when to implement scrum: ● Sprint - The sprint is the backbone of Scrum. It’s a timebox of between one and four weeks during which an increment of product or service work is completed and ready to send to the customer. 
			 ● Sprint Planning - The work to be completed in a sprint is planned by the entire Scrum team during planning.
			 ● Daily Scrum - this is a 15-minute daily meeting where the Scrum team discusses that 	day’s work
			 ● Sprint Review - Held at the end of a sprint, the sprint review is used to inspect the increment (work delivered) and adapt the product backlog,if required.
			 ● Sprint Retrospective- A meeting of the entire Scrum team, the sprint retrospective is used to create improvement opportunities.
